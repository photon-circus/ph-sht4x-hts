# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Initialized the bounded Sensirion SHT45 driver repository with an unpublished Incubating scaffold.
- Retained the source-backed SHT45 serial-number propositions used to unblock
  later driver and model work, including the command execution timing for the
  response read.
- Retained the source-backed SHT45 T/RH measurement propositions for command
  selection, maximum timing, integer conversion, and one-shot measurement
  data, without claiming the operation is implemented or model-conformant.
- Added the implementation-tested serial-number read through abstract async I2C,
  including the device-required command delay, mandatory CRC validation, and
  distinct no-acknowledge errors.
- Added implementation-tested high, medium, and low repeatability T/RH
  measurement with Table 5 maximum delays, mandatory CRC validation, and
  uncropped integer millidegree and milli-%RH conversion.
- Added an independent unpublished behavioral model for SHT45 serial-number and
  one-shot T/RH readouts, with explicit OTP and conversion-tick inputs, maximum
  busy frontiers, one-shot consumption, distinct out-of-fidelity and transaction
  errors, and model-only trace tests.
- Added an unpublished host-only conformance package that adapts the public
  driver I2C trace to the independent model, verifies the unequal-word
  `0x1234_5678` serial result and transmission order, and checks that a corrupted
  response produces the driver's CRC error.
- Added host-only model conformance for high, medium, and low T/RH measurement,
  including shared relative-delay advancement, injected `0xBEEF` ticks,
  independently asserted command and maximum-delay mappings, adapter CRC
  corruption, and a busy-model check for a no-op delay.
- Retained the source-backed SHT45 soft-reset command, 1 ms idle-time bound, and
  measurement-abort propositions from Datasheet D1 Version 7.3, without claiming
  reset implementation or model conformance.
- Added model-only soft-reset behavior that aborts an in-flight measurement,
  preserves the explicit OTP serial, and returns to idle after the 1 ms reset
  busy interval without claiming driver conformance or physical evidence.

### Known issues

- Model conformance covers serial-number read and T/RH measurement at all three
  repeatabilities; other operations are uncovered, and no operation is
  physically validated.
